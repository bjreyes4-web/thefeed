        <p>My boyfriend has a lovely day for us planned ahead since it will be our <em>third</em> Valentine's Day together. I was very excited!! I had seen many TikToks of this museum so I was super duper happy when I found out I was going!</p>

        <p>During our car ride I was on Instagram and, for context, I am now the VPEA for my sorority (KAϴ) and part of my role is to connect with external brands to send us PR and for media collabs -- so... every single brand I see I must take a photo or screenshot so I can give myself inspo!</p>
